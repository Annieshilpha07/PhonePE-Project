## Project Overview
PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration is a project that aims to extract, transform, and visualize data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. The project utilizes Python, Pandas, MySQL, mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard for exploring and understanding the data.

## Problem Statement
The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data, process it, and visualize it in a user-friendly manner. The solution must include steps such as data extraction, transformation, database insertion, and dashboard creation.

## Objectives
- Extract and transform data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.
- Store transformed data in a MySQL database.
- Create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
- Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard.

## Approach
1. **Data Extraction**: Clone the GitHub repository and fetch the data.
2. **Data Transformation**: Use Python and Pandas to clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Database Insertion**: Use mysql-connector-python to insert the transformed data into a MySQL database.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Use Streamlit and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard.
5. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data from the MySQL database to update the dashboard dynamically.
6. **Deployment**: Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly.

## Process
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the GitHub repository containing PhonePe data.
2. **Fetch Data**: Fetch data from JSON files.
3. **Transform and Filter**: Transform and filter data for specific states.
4. **Store Data**: Store transformed data in a MySQL database.
5. **Create Dashboard**: Create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
6. **Retrieve Data**: Retrieve data from MySQL for dynamic dashboard updates.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Install required Python libraries.
3. Set up a MySQL database.
4. Run the `project.py` script.-

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- Pandas
- MySQL

## Learning Outcomes
1. **Data Extraction and Processing:** Learn to extract and preprocess data using Pandas.
2. **Database Management:** Learn efficient data storage and retrieval using MySQL.
3. **Visualization and Dashboard Creation:** Master creating interactive dashboards with Streamlit and Plotly.
4. **Geo Visualization:** Understand how to visualize data on maps using Plotly.
5. **Dynamic Updating:** Learn to create dashboards that update with new data.
6. **Project Development and Deployment:** Develop user-friendly solutions, from extraction to deployment, ensuring security and efficiency.

## Results
The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays information and insights from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository in an interactive and visually appealing manner. Users will be able to access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed.
